This is a solution to [this](https://github.com/davidwhitney/CodeDojos/tree/master/Diamond%20Kata) coding challenge.

In order to run it as a console application, supply a single program argument, which should be the diamond's midpoint character. The application doesn't bother to verify the number of arguments nor that the first argument is a single character (simply taking the first character of the string).
It might have taken me less time to add that validation than to actually write this README but we live and we learn.
